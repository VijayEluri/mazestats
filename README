A program that can be used to determine the number of random steps necessary to
escape a maze.

Data needs to be sent to a statistical analysis program to analyze the data.

Maze files are assumed to be 10x10 and are in the format
x x x x x x x x x x
x x x x x x x x x x

where 0 means empty space and 1 means a wall.  Position 5,5 is assumed to be the
starting position and is expected to be empty.

This program was written for a University of New Hampshire course, MATH 539
Introduction to Statistical Analysis, final project.  The program was authored
by Patrick MacArthur and William Rideout.

The project was inspired by an MIT lecture for 6.00, an introductory computer
science class that was used to demostrate a Monte Carlo random walk simulation.
This program is an extension of that idea.
